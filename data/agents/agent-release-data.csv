Increases the minimum deployment target for iOS; from 8 to 9 (conflated in [\#1075](https://github.com/ably/ably-cocoa/pull/1075)). ### New Push Notification Registration API for apps using the SwiftUI App Lifecycle For new Swift-based apps created with Xcode 12; the default lifecycle is SwiftUI App. This means that the previous approach we supported of conforming to `ARTPushRegistererDelegate` on your `UIApplicationDelegate` no longer works. Going forward apps should use the `pushRegistererDelegate` property on client options to supply this delegate ([\#1075](https://github.com/ably/ably-cocoa/pull/1075)). ### Reduced Dependencies We've removed both KSCrash ([\#1073](https://github.com/ably/ably-cocoa/pull/1073)) and SAMKeychain ([\#1067](https://github.com/ably/ably-cocoa/pull/1067)). In Cocoa there is no effective way to catch selectively only those exceptions that occur within the library; and the attempt to do that using KCrash was interfering with app developers' own exception handling. Our advice is that app developers incorporate their own application-wide exception handling and crash reporting. ## Fixed issues: - Deadlock getting ARTRealtimeChannel between two dispatch\_sync \(ui queue vs ably main queue\) [\#1029](https://github.com/ably/ably-cocoa/issues/1029) - Push Notification Registration via `ARTPushRegistererDelegate` don't work in iOS 14 when instantiated via @UIApplicationDelegateAdaptor [\#1069](https://github.com/ably/ably-cocoa/issues/1069) - Conflict KSCrashAblyFork [\#1068](https://github.com/ably/ably-cocoa/issues/1068) ## Merged pull requests: - Support ARTPushRegistererDelegate on iOS 14 [\#1075](https://github.com/ably/ably-cocoa/pull/1075) ([QuintinWillison](https://github.com/QuintinWillison)) - Remove KSCrash and unhandled exception handlers [\#1073](https://github.com/ably/ably-cocoa/pull/1073) ([QuintinWillison](https://github.com/QuintinWillison)) - Remove SAMKeychain dependency and use internal solution [\#1067](https://github.com/ably/ably-cocoa/pull/1067) ([ricardopereira](https://github.com/ricardopereira)) - Fix Push State Machine delegate syncing the main queue [\#1064](https://github.com/ably/ably-cocoa/pull/1064) ([ricardopereira](https://github.com/ricardopereira)) - Add `use\_frameworks!` recommendation [\#1061](https://github.com/ably/ably-cocoa/pull/1061) ([kavalerov](https://github.com/kavalerov)) - Correct CocoaPods instruction [\#1060](https://github.com/ably/ably-cocoa/pull/1060) ([kavalerov](https://github.com/kavalerov)) - Bump protocol version to 1.2 [\#1058](https://github.com/ably/ably-cocoa/pull/1058) ([QuintinWillison](https://github.com/QuintinWillison)) - Fix some `waitUntil` error "expects its completion closure to be only called once" [\#1028](https://github.com/ably/ably-cocoa/pull/1028) ([ricardopereira](https://github.com/ricardopereira)) [Full Changelog](https://github.com/ably/ably-cocoa/compare/1.2.1...1.2.2) ## Versions **Podfile** ``` pod 'Ably'; '1.2.2' ``` **Cartfile** ``` github "ably/ably-cocoa" == 1.2.2 ``` **Objective-C** ``` objective-c #import <Ably/Ably.h> ``` **Swift** ``` swift import Ably ``` ## Compatibility - Carthage release for Swift is built with Xcode 12.0.1.

ably-dotnet,1.1.15-beta1,2019-11-01,beta,2020-11-01,2021-11-01,2025-11-01,Protocol v2 migration - SDK versions that do not support Ably protocol v2 will no longer be supported,1.2.15,2024-04-19,Version 1.1.15 includes significant internal library rewrite for safety and future spec implementation; notable changes include IDisposable interface removal and deprecation of `CaptureCurrentSynchronizationContext`.,## Significant changes in 1.1.15 Version 1.1.15 has seen a significant rewrite of the library internals which was needed to make the library safer and provide a good basis for implementing the rest of the spec. Here is a list of the significant changes. You can find a full list in the release notes. 1. [Breaking]Presence and IRealtimeChannel no longer implement the IDisposable interface. They don't hold on to any unmanaged recourses and there was no need to expose the Dispose function. 2. [Breaking]ITransport has acquired an Id Property and ITransportListener.OnTransportEvent has an Id parameter. This is needed because we need to distinguish events raised different Transport instances. Sometimes the Closed event doesn't get processed until another transport has already been instantiated. 3. `ClientOptions.CaptureCurrentSynchronizationContext` has been deprecated and defaulted to `false`. It will be removed in future versions. You need to make sure that you don't directly update UI elements if you are building a WPF or Xamarin.Forms application from Ably handlers. If you still require the functionality please set it back to `true` and open an Ably Support ticket that you need the functionality. The main reason to disable this feature is that the library should not assume on which thread updates should be posted and that needs to be handled by the developer. 4. IRealtimeClient implements IDisposable - If you want to clean up after the library you can now safely call `Dispose()`. Please note that you can no longer use this instance and have to create a new one. 5. Logging has been greatly improved. We've removed a lot of verbose messages that brought little value. There is a helpful debug method called `.GetCurrentState()` on the realtime client that will dump the whole library's state as a json string. This will be helpful to include in the support tickets. ## [1.1.15-beta1](https://github.com/ably/ably-dotnet/tree/1.1.15-beta1) [Full Changelog](https://github.com/ably/ably-dotnet/compare/1.1.14...1.1.15-beta1) **Implemented enhancements:** - Improve library internals [\#363](https://github.com/ably/ably-dotnet/issues/363) **Fixed bugs:** - Handle Presence Sync with empty list of presence messages [\#379](https://github.com/ably/ably-dotnet/issues/379) - Using a clientId should no longer be forcing token auth in the 1.1 spec [\#330](https://github.com/ably/ably-dotnet/issues/330) **Closed issues:** - Resuming after Windows has been asleep \(.Net Framework\) [\#332](https://github.com/ably/ably-dotnet/issues/332) - Detecting network availability changes [\#331](https://github.com/ably/ably-dotnet/issues/331) **Merged pull requests:** - Poc/channels [\#372](https://github.com/ably/ably-dotnet/pull/372) ([marto83](https://github.com/marto83))

ably-js,2.0.0,2024-03-22,stable,2025-03-22,2026-03-22,,,2.10.1,2025-07-16,Ably-js v2.0.0 release includes new features; bundle size reduction; Promise support; React Hooks; TypeScript enhancements; and migration guides for breaking changes.,The 2.0.0 release introduces a number of new features and QoL improvements; including a new way to remove bloat and reduce the bundle size of your ably-js client; first-class support for Promises; a more idiomatic approach to using ably-js' React Hooks; enhancements to TypeScript typings; and more. Below is an overview of the major changes in this release. Please refer to the ably-js v2 [lib migration guide](https://github.com/ably/ably-js/blob/main/docs/migration-guides/v2/lib.md) and [React Hooks migration guide](https://github.com/ably/ably-js/blob/main/docs/migration-guides/v2/react-hooks.md) for the full details; including a list of all breaking changes and instructions on how to address them. ### Bundle Size Reduction The default bundle size for the web has been reduced by ~32% compared to v1 - from 234.11 KiB to 159.32 KiB. When calculated with gzip compression; the reduction is ~30%; from 82.54 KiB to 57.9 KiB. Additionally; by utilizing the new modular variant of the library (see below) and JavaScript tree shaking; you can create your own minimal useful `Realtime` client and achieve a bundle size reduction of ~60.5% compared to v1 - from 234.11 KiB to 92.38 KiB (or ~66% for gzip: from 82.54 KiB to 28.18 KiB). ### Modular variant of the library An ESM variant of the library is now available for browsers (but not for Node.js) via import from `ably/modular`. This modular variant of the library supports tree shaking; allowing for a reduction in the Ably bundle size within your application and improving the user experience. It can also be used by Web Workers. ### React Hooks changes React Hooks; exported at `ably/react`; now require the new `ChannelProvider` component to define the channels you wish to use and the options for them. This addresses the complexities previously encountered with `useChannel` and `usePresence` hooks when attempting to dynamically change options for a channel and provides a more straightforward approach to set and manage these options. The functionality of the `usePresence` hook has been split into two separate hooks: `usePresence`; which is now used only to enter presence; and `usePresenceListener`; which is used to listen for presence updates. These new hooks offer better control over the desired presence behavior in your React components. ### First-class support for Promises The callbacks API has been entirely removed; and the library now supports promises for all its asynchronous operations by default. ### TypeScript typings The Types namespace has been removed. All types it contained are now exported at the top level. ### Browser and Web Worker bundles - The browser bundle now relies on the native Web Crypto API instead of CryptoJS. The `ably/build/ably.noencryption` bundle has been removed; as it is no longer necessary. - The browser bundle can now be directly used by Web Workers. The `ably/build/ably-webworker` bundle has been removed; as it is no longer necessary. ### Supported platforms changes - Support for Internet Explorer has been dropped. - Support for Node.js versions lower than 16 has been dropped. The supported Node.js versions are now 16; 18; and 20. - The minimum supported versions for major browsers are: Chrome 58; Firefox 52; Edge 79; Safari 11; and Opera 45. <details> <summary><b>View merged Pull Requests</b></summary> ### Breaking Changes - Add `ChannelProvider` component to React Hooks [\#1620](https://github.com/ably/ably-js/pull/1620); [\#1654](https://github.com/ably/ably-js/pull/1654) - Add untyped stats API [\#1522](https://github.com/ably/ably-js/pull/1522) - Add type definitions for key returned by `generateRandomKey` [\#1320](https://github.com/ably/ably-js/pull/1320) - Add mandatory `version` param to `Rest.request` [\#1231](https://github.com/ably/ably-js/pull/1231) - Change `id` field to be named `ablyId` in React Hooks [\#1676](https://github.com/ably/ably-js/pull/1676) - Change `usePresence` hook to two different hooks: for entering presence and subscribing to presence updates [\#1674](https://github.com/ably/ably-js/pull/1674) - Change naming for enum-like namespaces in type declarations and change meaning for public `ChannelModes` type [\#1601](https://github.com/ably/ably-js/pull/1601) - Change publishing methods to accept a `Message`-shaped object [\#1515](https://github.com/ably/ably-js/pull/1515) - Change `Crypto.generateRandomKey` API to use Promises [\#1351](https://github.com/ably/ably-js/pull/1351) - Change `fromEncoded()` and `fromEncodedArray()` methods on `Message` and `PresenceMessage` to be async [\#1311](https://github.com/ably/ably-js/pull/1311) - Remove `XHRStreaming` transport support [\#1645](https://github.com/ably/ably-js/pull/1645) - Remove code that's supporting older platforms [\#1629](https://github.com/ably/ably-js/pull/1629); [\#1633](https://github.com/ably/ably-js/pull/1633); [\#1641](https://github.com/ably/ably-js/pull/1641) - Remove `recoveryKey` in favour of `createRecoveryKey()` on `Connection` [\#1613](https://github.com/ably/ably-js/pull/1613) - Remove `any` from `stats()` param type [\#1561](https://github.com/ably/ably-js/pull/1561) - Remove the dedicated Web Worker bundle `ably/build/ably-webworker` and add support for using `ably` and `ably/modular` in Web Workers [\#1550](https://github.com/ably/ably-js/pull/1550) - Remove false class exports in type declarations [\#1524](https://github.com/ably/ably-js/pull/1524) - Remove the `Types` namespace [\#1518](https://github.com/ably/ably-js/pull/1518) - Remove `noencryption` variant of the library [\#1500](https://github.com/ably/ably-js/pull/1500) - Remove public callbacks API [\#1358](https://github.com/ably/ably-js/pull/1358) - Remove CryptoJS library and replace it with the Web Crypto API in web bundle [\#1299](https://github.com/ably/ably-js/pull/1299); [\#1325](https://github.com/ably/ably-js/pull/1325); [\#1333](https://github.com/ably/ably-js/pull/1333) - Remove `ably-commonjs*.js` files [\#1229](https://github.com/ably/ably-js/pull/1229) - Remove deprecated APIs [\#1227](https://github.com/ably/ably-js/pull/1227) - Remove deprecated `fromEncoded*` type declarations [\#1222](https://github.com/ably/ably-js/pull/1222) - Remove deprecated `ClientOptions` parameters [\#1221](https://github.com/ably/ably-js/pull/1221) - Remove the `ClientOptions.log` property and replace it with separate `logLevel` and `logHandler` properties [\#1216](https://github.com/ably/ably-js/pull/1216) - Remove support for JSONP [\#1215](https://github.com/ably/ably-js/pull/1215) - Fix `whenState` inconsistent behavior in `Connection` and `RealtimeChannel` [\#1640](https://github.com/ably/ably-js/pull/1640) - Fix the type definition of `Crypto.getDefaultParams` [\#1352](https://github.com/ably/ably-js/pull/1352) ### Features - Add `publish` function to the `useChannel` hook [\#1658](https://github.com/ably/ably-js/pull/1658) - Add logs to all HTTP activity [\#1581](https://github.com/ably/ably-js/pull/1581) </details> [Full Changelog](https://github.com/ably/ably-js/compare/1.2.50...2.0.0)

[#382](https://github.com/ably/ably-chat-js/pull/382) - Renamed the `timeserial` field on the `Message` type to `serial`. Messages may now be compared for global order by string comparison of this field. - `Rooms.get` is now asynchronous and returns a `Promise` that will resolve once any `release` operations on the room are complete. [#387](https://github.com/ably/ably-chat-js/pull/387). - The `Room.channel` property is now an instance of `Ably.RealtimeChannel`; rather than a `Promise`. [#387](https://github.com/ably/ably-chat-js/pull/387) - In React; accessing the room via `useRoom`; or properties of the room via other hooks; now returns `ValueType | undefined`. Once the room's promise is resolved (see above); this will update to the actual value. [#387](https://github.com/ably/ably-chat-js/pull/387) - The default Room status is now `Initialized`. The `Initializing` status is retained for use in React when the room has not yet been resolved.

[#362](https://github.com/ably/ably-chat-js/pull/362) - Added the ability to delete messages in the chat. [#365](https://github.com/ably/ably-chat-js/pull/365) - Added the ability to edit messages in the chat. [#378](https://github.com/ably/ably-chat-js/pull/378) ### Fixed Bugs - The Room will now transition immediately to `released` if `release` is called whilst its status is `Initialized`. [#400](https://github.com/ably/ably-chat-js/pull/400) - When paginating messages (e.g. via `getPreviousMessages`) the objects returned by successive pages will now fully implement the `Message` interface. Previously they were simple JSON objects after the first page. [#403](https://github.com/ably/ably-chat-js/pull/403). - Fixed a bug whereby a room may get stuck in the `Suspended` status after network issues. [#409](https://github.com/ably/ably-chat-js/pull/409) ### Other Changes - `ably-chat` is no longer a reserved key on Message and Reaction metadata/headers. [#374](https://github.com/ably/ably-chat-js/pull/374)

For more information on how to get started with Chat in React; see [the React README](./src/react/README.md). - When a new room is returned from rooms.get() we now guarantee that the returned object is usable. Previously if the room was being released; the releasing room was returned. If needed; async operations wait for the previous release to finish behind-the-scenes. - Added message parsing helpers that convert regular Ably Pub/Sub messages into Chat entities; which can be used on existing post-publish channel rules [#249](https://github.com/ably/ably-chat-js/pull/249). - Improved documentation around getting previous messages for a given subscription [#328](https://github.com/ably/ably-chat-js/pull/328) - The CDN bundle for the core Chat SDK is now in UMD format; as opposed to ESM.

[#382](https://github.com/ably/ably-chat-js/pull/382) - Renamed the `timeserial` field on the `Message` type to `serial`. Messages may now be compared for global order by string comparison of this field. - `Rooms.get` is now asynchronous and returns a `Promise` that will resolve once any `release` operations on the room are complete. [#387](https://github.com/ably/ably-chat-js/pull/387). - The `Room.channel` property is now an instance of `Ably.RealtimeChannel`; rather than a `Promise`. [#387](https://github.com/ably/ably-chat-js/pull/387) - In React; accessing the room via `useRoom`; or properties of the room via other hooks; now returns `ValueType | undefined`. Once the room's promise is resolved (see above); this will update to the actual value. [#387](https://github.com/ably/ably-chat-js/pull/387) - The default Room status is now `Initialized`. The `Initializing` status is retained for use in React when the room has not yet been resolved.

[#362](https://github.com/ably/ably-chat-js/pull/362) - Added the ability to delete messages in the chat. [#365](https://github.com/ably/ably-chat-js/pull/365) - Added the ability to edit messages in the chat. [#378](https://github.com/ably/ably-chat-js/pull/378) ### Fixed Bugs - The Room will now transition immediately to `released` if `release` is called whilst its status is `Initialized`. [#400](https://github.com/ably/ably-chat-js/pull/400) - When paginating messages (e.g. via `getPreviousMessages`) the objects returned by successive pages will now fully implement the `Message` interface. Previously they were simple JSON objects after the first page. [#403](https://github.com/ably/ably-chat-js/pull/403). - Fixed a bug whereby a room may get stuck in the `Suspended` status after network issues. [#409](https://github.com/ably/ably-chat-js/pull/409) ### Other Changes - `ably-chat` is no longer a reserved key on Message and Reaction metadata/headers. [#374](https://github.com/ably/ably-chat-js/pull/374)

For more information on how to get started with Chat in React; see [the React README](./src/react/README.md). - When a new room is returned from rooms.get() we now guarantee that the returned object is usable. Previously if the room was being released; the releasing room was returned. If needed; async operations wait for the previous release to finish behind-the-scenes. - Added message parsing helpers that convert regular Ably Pub/Sub messages into Chat entities; which can be used on existing post-publish channel rules [#249](https://github.com/ably/ably-chat-js/pull/249). - Improved documentation around getting previous messages for a given subscription [#328](https://github.com/ably/ably-chat-js/pull/328) - The CDN bundle for the core Chat SDK is now in UMD format; as opposed to ESM. This will still work in both browsers and Node. The README instructions have been updated to reflect this [#333](https://github.com/ably/ably-chat-js/pull/333).

react-hooks,2.0.0,2024-03-22,stable,2025-03-22,2026-03-22,,,2.10.1,2025-07-16,Ably-js v2.0.0 release includes new features; bundle size reduction; Promise support; React Hooks; TypeScript enhancements; and more.,The 2.0.0 release introduces a number of new features and QoL improvements; including a new way to remove bloat and reduce the bundle size of your ably-js client; first-class support for Promises; a more idiomatic approach to using ably-js' React Hooks; enhancements to TypeScript typings; and more. Below is an overview of the major changes in this release. Please refer to the ably-js v2 [lib migration guide](https://github.com/ably/ably-js/blob/main/docs/migration-guides/v2/lib.md) and [React Hooks migration guide](https://github.com/ably/ably-js/blob/main/docs/migration-guides/v2/react-hooks.md) for the full details; including a list of all breaking changes and instructions on how to address them. ### Bundle Size Reduction The default bundle size for the web has been reduced by ~32% compared to v1 - from 234.11 KiB to 159.32 KiB. When calculated with gzip compression; the reduction is ~30%; from 82.54 KiB to 57.9 KiB. Additionally; by utilizing the new modular variant of the library (see below) and JavaScript tree shaking; you can create your own minimal useful `Realtime` client and achieve a bundle size reduction of ~60.5% compared to v1 - from 234.11 KiB to 92.38 KiB (or ~66% for gzip: from 82.54 KiB to 28.18 KiB). ### Modular variant of the library An ESM variant of the library is now available for browsers (but not for Node.js) via import from `ably/modular`. This modular variant of the library supports tree shaking; allowing for a reduction in the Ably bundle size within your application and improving the user experience. It can also be used by Web Workers. ### React Hooks changes React Hooks; exported at `ably/react`; now require the new `ChannelProvider` component to define the channels you wish to use and the options for them. This addresses the complexities previously encountered with `useChannel` and `usePresence` hooks when attempting to dynamically change options for a channel and provides a more straightforward approach to set and manage these options. The functionality of the `usePresence` hook has been split into two separate hooks: `usePresence`; which is now used only to enter presence; and `usePresenceListener`; which is used to listen for presence updates. These new hooks offer better control over the desired presence behavior in your React components. ### First-class support for Promises The callbacks API has been entirely removed; and the library now supports promises for all its asynchronous operations by default. ### TypeScript typings The Types namespace has been removed. All types it contained are now exported at the top level. ### Browser and Web Worker bundles - The browser bundle now relies on the native Web Crypto API instead of CryptoJS. The `ably/build/ably.noencryption` bundle has been removed; as it is no longer necessary. - The browser bundle can now be directly used by Web Workers. The `ably/build/ably-webworker` bundle has been removed; as it is no longer necessary. ### Supported platforms changes - Support for Internet Explorer has been dropped. - Support for Node.js versions lower than 16 has been dropped. The supported Node.js versions are now 16; 18; and 20. - The minimum supported versions for major browsers are: Chrome 58; Firefox 52; Edge 79; Safari 11; and Opera 45. <details> <summary><b>View merged Pull Requests</b></summary> ### Breaking Changes - Add `ChannelProvider` component to React Hooks [\#1620](https://github.com/ably/ably-js/pull/1620); [\#1654](https://github.com/ably/ably-js/pull/1654) - Add untyped stats API [\#1522](https://github.com/ably/ably-js/pull/1522) - Add type definitions for key returned by `generateRandomKey` [\#1320](https://github.com/ably/ably-js/pull/1320) - Add mandatory `version` param to `Rest.request` [\#1231](https://github.com/ably/ably-js/pull/1231) - Change `id` field to be named `ablyId` in React Hooks [\#1676](https://github.com/ably/ably-js/pull/1676) - Change `usePresence` hook to two different hooks: for entering presence and subscribing to presence updates [\#1674](https://github.com/ably/ably-js/pull/1674) - Change naming for enum-like namespaces in type declarations and change meaning for public `ChannelModes` type [\#1601](https://github.com/ably/ably-js/pull/1601) - Change publishing methods to accept a `Message`-shaped object [\#1515](https://github.com/ably/ably-js/pull/1515) - Change `Crypto.generateRandomKey` API to use Promises [\#1351](https://github.com/ably/ably-js/pull/1351) - Change `fromEncoded()` and `fromEncodedArray()` methods on `Message` and `PresenceMessage` to be async [\#1311](https://github.com/ably/ably-js/pull/1311) - Remove `XHRStreaming` transport support [\#1645](https://github.com/ably/ably-js/pull/1645) - Remove code that's supporting older platforms [\#1629](https://github.com/ably/ably-js/pull/1629); [\#1633](https://github.com/ably/ably-js/pull/1633); [\#1641](https://github.com/ably/ably-js/pull/1641) - Remove `recoveryKey` in favour of `createRecoveryKey()` on `Connection` [\#1613](https://github.com/ably/ably-js/pull/1613) - Remove `any` from `stats()` param type [\#1561](https://github.com/ably/ably-js/pull/1561) - Remove the dedicated Web Worker bundle `ably/build/ably-webworker` and add support for using `ably` and `ably/modular` in Web Workers [\#1550](https://github.com/ably/ably-js/pull/1550) - Remove false class exports in type declarations [\#1524](https://github.com/ably/ably-js/pull/1524) - Remove the `Types` namespace [\#1518](https://github.com/ably/ably-js/pull/1518) - Remove `noencryption` variant of the library [\#1500](https://github.com/ably/ably-js/pull/1500) - Remove public callbacks API [\#1358](https://github.com/ably/ably-js/pull/1358) - Remove CryptoJS library and replace it with the Web Crypto API in web bundle [\#1299](https://github.com/ably/ably-js/pull/1299); [\#1325](https://github.com/ably/ably-js/pull/1325); [\#1333](https://github.com/ably/ably-js/pull/1333) - Remove `ably-commonjs*.js` files [\#1229](https://github.com/ably/ably-js/pull/1229) - Remove deprecated APIs [\#1227](https://github.com/ably/ably-js/pull/1227) - Remove deprecated `fromEncoded*` type declarations [\#1222](https://github.com/ably/ably-js/pull/1222) - Remove deprecated `ClientOptions` parameters [\#1221](https://github.com/ably/ably-js/pull/1221) - Remove the `ClientOptions.log` property and replace it with separate `logLevel` and `logHandler` properties [\#1216](https://github.com/ably/ably-js/pull/1216) - Remove support for JSONP [\#1215](https://github.com/ably/ably-js/pull/1215) - Fix `whenState` inconsistent behavior in `Connection` and `RealtimeChannel` [\#1640](https://github.com/ably/ably-js/pull/1640) - Fix the type definition of `Crypto.getDefaultParams` [\#1352](https://github.com/ably/ably-js/pull/1352) ### Features - Add `publish` function to the `useChannel` hook [\#1658](https://github.com/ably/ably-js/pull/1658) - Add logs to all HTTP activity [\#1581](https://github.com/ably/ably-js/pull/1581) </details> [Full Changelog](https://github.com/ably/ably-js/compare/1.2.50...2.0.0)

react-hooks,1.2.0,2020-06-08,stable,2021-06-08,2022-06-08,2025-11-01,Protocol v2 migration - SDK versions that do not support Ably protocol v2 will no longer be supported,2.10.1,2025-07-16,Enables subscribing to a channel in delta mode for efficient message payload transmission.,Adds the capability to subscribe to a channel in delta mode. Subscribing to a channel in delta mode enables [delta compression](https://www.ably.io/documentation/realtime/channels/channel-parameters/deltas). This is a way for a client to subscribe to a channel so that message payloads sent contain only the difference (ie the delta) between the present message and the previous message on the channel.

Below is an overview of the major changes in this release. Please refer to the ably-js v2 [lib migration guide](https://github.com/ably/ably-js/blob/main/docs/migration-guides/v2/lib.md) and [React Hooks migration guide](https://github.com/ably/ably-js/blob/main/docs/migration-guides/v2/react-hooks.md) for the full details; including a list of all breaking changes and instructions on how to address them. ### Bundle Size Reduction The default bundle size for the web has been reduced by ~32% compared to v1 - from 234.11 KiB to 159.32 KiB. When calculated with gzip compression; the reduction is ~30%; from 82.54 KiB to 57.9 KiB. Additionally; by utilizing the new modular variant of the library (see below) and JavaScript tree shaking; you can create your own minimal useful `Realtime` client and achieve a bundle size reduction of ~60.5% compared to v1 - from 234.11 KiB to 92.38 KiB (or ~66% for gzip: from 82.54 KiB to 28.18 KiB). ### Modular variant of the library An ESM variant of the library is now available for browsers (but not for Node.js) via import from `ably/modular`. This modular variant of the library supports tree shaking; allowing for a reduction in the Ably bundle size within your application and improving the user experience. It can also be used by Web Workers. ### React Hooks changes React Hooks; exported at `ably/react`; now require the new `ChannelProvider` component to define the channels you wish to use and the options for them. This addresses the complexities previously encountered with `useChannel` and `usePresence` hooks when attempting to dynamically change options for a channel and provides a more straightforward approach to set and manage these options. The functionality of the `usePresence` hook has been split into two separate hooks: `usePresence`; which is now used only to enter presence; and `usePresenceListener`; which is used to listen for presence updates. These new hooks offer better control over the desired presence behavior in your React components. ### First-class support for Promises The callbacks API has been entirely removed; and the library now supports promises for all its asynchronous operations by default. ### TypeScript typings The Types namespace has been removed. All types it contained are now exported at the top level. ### Browser and Web Worker bundles - The browser bundle now relies on the native Web Crypto API instead of CryptoJS. The `ably/build/ably.noencryption` bundle has been removed; as it is no longer necessary. - The browser bundle can now be directly used by Web Workers. The `ably/build/ably-webworker` bundle has been removed; as it is no longer necessary. ### Supported platforms changes - Support for Internet Explorer has been dropped. - Support for Node.js versions lower than 16 has been dropped. The supported Node.js versions are now 16; 18; and 20. - The minimum supported versions for major browsers are: Chrome 58; Firefox 52; Edge 79; Safari 11; and Opera 45. <details> <summary><b>View merged Pull Requests</b></summary> ### Breaking Changes - Add `ChannelProvider` component to React Hooks [\#1620](https://github.com/ably/ably-js/pull/1620); [\#1654](https://github.com/ably/ably-js/pull/1654) - Add untyped stats API [\#1522](https://github.com/ably/ably-js/pull/1522) - Add type definitions for key returned by `generateRandomKey` [\#1320](https://github.com/ably/ably-js/pull/1320) - Add mandatory `version` param to `Rest.request` [\#1231](https://github.com/ably/ably-js/pull/1231) - Change `id` field to be named `ablyId` in React Hooks [\#1676](https://github.com/ably/ably-js/pull/1676) - Change `usePresence` hook to two different hooks: for entering presence and subscribing to presence updates [\#1674](https://github.com/ably/ably-js/pull/1674) - Change naming for enum-like namespaces in type declarations and change meaning for public `ChannelModes` type [\#1601](https://github.com/ably/ably-js/pull/1601) - Change publishing methods to accept a `Message`-shaped object [\#1515](https://github.com/ably/ably-js/pull/1515) - Change `Crypto.generateRandomKey` API to use Promises [\#1351](https://github.com/ably/ably-js/pull/1351) - Change `fromEncoded()` and `fromEncodedArray()` methods on `Message` and `PresenceMessage` to be async [\#1311](https://github.com/ably/ably-js/pull/1311) - Remove `XHRStreaming` transport support [\#1645](https://github.com/ably/ably-js/pull/1645) - Remove code that's supporting older platforms [\#1629](https://github.com/ably/ably-js/pull/1629); [\#1633](https://github.com/ably/ably-js/pull/1633); [\#1641](https://github.com/ably/ably-js/pull/1641) - Remove `recoveryKey` in favour of `createRecoveryKey()` on `Connection` [\#1613](https://github.com/ably/ably-js/pull/1613) - Remove `any` from `stats()` param type [\#1561](https://github.com/ably/ably-js/pull/1561) - Remove the dedicated Web Worker bundle `ably/build/ably-webworker` and add support for using `ably` and `ably/modular` in Web Workers [\#1550](https://github.com/ably/ably-js/pull/1550) - Remove false class exports in type declarations [\#1524](https://github.com/ably/ably-js/pull/1524) - Remove the `Types` namespace [\#1518](https://github.com/ably/ably-js/pull/1518) - Remove `noencryption` variant of the library [\#1500](https://github.com/ably/ably-js/pull/1500) - Remove public callbacks API [\#1358](https://github.com/ably/ably-js/pull/1358) - Remove CryptoJS library and replace it with the Web Crypto API in web bundle [\#1299](https://github.com/ably/ably-js/pull/1299); [\#1325](https://github.com/ably/ably-js/pull/1325); [\#1333](https://github.com/ably/ably-js/pull/1333) - Remove `ably-commonjs*.js` files [\#1229](https://github.com/ably/ably-js/pull/1229) - Remove deprecated APIs [\#1227](https://github.com/ably/ably-js/pull/1227) - Remove deprecated `fromEncoded*` type declarations [\#1222](https://github.com/ably/ably-js/pull/1222) - Remove deprecated `ClientOptions` parameters [\#1221](https://github.com/ably/ably-js/pull/1221) - Remove the `ClientOptions.log` property and replace it with separate `logLevel` and `logHandler` properties [\#1216](https://github.com/ably/ably-js/pull/1216) - Remove support for JSONP [\#1215](https://github.com/ably/ably-js/pull/1215) - Fix `whenState` inconsistent behavior in `Connection` and `RealtimeChannel` [\#1640](https://github.com/ably/ably-js/pull/1640) - Fix the type definition of `Crypto.getDefaultParams` [\#1352](https://github.com/ably/ably-js/pull/1352) ### Features - Add `publish` function to the `useChannel` hook [\#1658](https://github.com/ably/ably-js/pull/1658) - Add logs to all HTTP activity [\#1581](https://github.com/ably/ably-js/pull/1581) </details> [Full Changelog](https://github.com/ably/ably-js/compare/1.2.50...2.0.0)

spaces,0.1.0,2023-09-04,stable,2024-09-04,2025-09-04,,,0.4.0,2024-07-17,Spaces library has transitioned from alpha to beta; now maintained by `ably`; early adopters must update `package.json` to `@ably/spaces`; with available APIs including Space; Avatar stack; and Member locations.,In this release; we're advancing Spaces from alpha to beta. Along with introducing this library to a wider audience; we've decided to move it to the `ably` organisation as Spaces is no longer an experiment; it's something we see as an excellent supplement to our core SDKs to help developers build collaborative environments in their apps. We are committed to grow and officially maintain it. If you are one of our early adopters; this means you need to update your `package.json` from `@ably-labs/spaces` to `@ably/spaces`. Visit [official documentation on Ably's website](https://ably.com/docs/spaces) to learn more about Spaces and understand what the beta status means for you. The following APIs are currently available: - **Space** - a virtual area of your application in which realtime collaboration between users can take place. - **Avatar stack** - the most common way of showing the online status of users in an application. - **Member locations** - track where users are to see which part of your application they're interacting with. - **Live cursors** - track the cursor positions of users in realtime. - **Component locking** - optimistically lock stateful UI components before editing them. Your feedback will help prioritize improvements and fixes in subsequent releases. Spaces features have been validated for a set of use-cases; but breaking changes may still occur between minor releases until we reach 1.0.0. The beta is implemented based on real world situations and loads; but we'd advise to take caution when adding it to production environments. Please reach out to [beta@ably.com](mailto:beta@ably.com) for any questions or share feedback through [this form]( https://go.ably.com/spaces-feedback). ## What's Changed * Add legacy CDN upload by @surminus in https://github.com/ably/spaces/pull/134 * [MMB-219] Update docs by @surminus in https://github.com/ably/spaces/pull/113 * [MMB-44] Ensure we're setting proper error codes by @surminus in https://github.com/ably/spaces/pull/135 * Locking demo by @dpiatek in https://github.com/ably/spaces/pull/111 * build(deps-dev): bump eslint from 8.33.0 to 8.48.0 by @dependabot in https://github.com/ably/spaces/pull/138 * chore!: make `ably` peer dependency by @ttypic in https://github.com/ably/spaces/pull/128 * fix: rename `types.d.ts` to `types.ts` by @ttypic in https://github.com/ably/spaces/pull/130 * Support async subscribe callbacks by @lmars in https://github.com/ably/spaces/pull/139 * CDN bundle updates by @dpiatek in https://github.com/ably/spaces/pull/140 * chore: use npm versions in demo by @ttypic in https://github.com/ably/spaces/pull/143 * Prefer null over undefined consistently by @dpiatek in https://github.com/ably/spaces/pull/141 * build(deps-dev): bump eslint-plugin-import from 2.27.5 to 2.28.1 by @dependabot in https://github.com/ably/spaces/pull/123 * build(deps-dev): bump vitest from 0.29.8 to 0.34.3 by @dependabot in https://github.com/ably/spaces/pull/137 * fix: locking demo bugs by @ttypic in https://github.com/ably/spaces/pull/146 * Fix getAll no returing position or data values by @dpiatek in https://github.com/ably/spaces/pull/144 * Remove mock-socket by @dpiatek in https://github.com/ably/spaces/pull/145 * build(deps-dev): bump rollup from 3.28.0 to 3.28.1 by @dependabot in https://github.com/ably/spaces/pull/147 * build(deps-dev): bump @typescript-eslint/parser from 5.51.0 to 5.62.0 by @dependabot in https://github.com/ably/spaces/pull/149 * build(deps-dev): bump @vitest/coverage-c8 from 0.28.4 to 0.33.0 by @dependabot in https://github.com/ably/spaces/pull/148 * Update channel behaviours doc by @dpiatek in https://github.com/ably/spaces/pull/150 * [MMB-264] Flatten the lock type by @dpiatek in https://github.com/ably/spaces/pull/151 * Documentation tweaks post-API updates by @dpiatek in https://github.com/ably/spaces/pull/142 * [MMB-202] Add documentation for simple connection and channels management by @dpiatek in https://github.com/ably/spaces/pull/110 * [MMB-266] Add getSelf and getOthers methods to locks by @dpiatek in https://github.com/ably/spaces/pull/155 * docs: Add Component Locking section to README by @lmars in https://github.com/ably/spaces/pull/112 * [MMB-275] Update members update event by @dpiatek in https://github.com/ably/spaces/pull/156 * [MMB-127] Update repo references by @dpiatek in https://github.com/ably/spaces/pull/157 * Release 0.1.0 by @dpiatek in https://github.com/ably/spaces/pull/158 ## New Contributors * @ttypic made their first contribution in https://github.com/ably/spaces/pull/128 **Full Changelog**: https://github.com/ably/spaces/compare/0.0.13...0.1.0
