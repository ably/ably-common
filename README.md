# Ably - Common Resources

[![.github/workflows/check.yml](https://github.com/ably/ably-common/actions/workflows/check.yml/badge.svg)](https://github.com/ably/ably-common/actions/workflows/check.yml)

## Overview

This repository contains files shared across [Ably](https://www.ably.com),
the platform that powers synchronized digital experiences in realtime.

## Usage in Downstream Repositories

We are including the entire contents of this repository in the working copies of the downstream repositories (a.k.a. superprojects) which depend on it. This is simplistic but it allows us to trivially include this repository as a Git [submodule](https://git-scm.com/docs/gitsubmodules) in those repositories.

In the future we may well consider pushing out some of the artifacts contained (or perhaps generated) here out to package repositories.
See [#70](https://github.com/ably/ably-common/issues/70) for more detail.
