Client Instance Creation:
  .specification: RSC1
  .synopsis: |
    An SDK announcing support for any of these construction inputs must support those
    inputs for all client types it offers.
  With API Key:
  With Client Options:
  With Token String:
Options:
  .synopsis: |
    `ClientOptions` that apply to both client types (REST and Realtime).
  Authentication:
    .synopsis: |
      `AuthOptions`
    Callback:
      .api_documentation: |
        For non-browser clients, an authentication callback is the preferred method of implementing token refresh, although browser clients can also use `authCallback` if the use case requires it.
        This relies on your application communicating securely with your own servers to obtain a token.
      .specification: [RSA4a, RSA4, TO3j5, AO2b]
      .synopsis: |
        `authCallback`:
        Service `Auth#requestToken` calls by invoking a callback (`authCallback`).
    Key:
      .specification: [RSA11, TO3j1, AO2a]
      .synopsis: |
        `key`:
        Authenticate using a full Ably key string, as obtained from the dashboard,
        featuring a key name and key secret.
    Query Time:
      .specification: [TO3j10, RSA9d, RSA10k, AO2g]
      .synopsis: |
        `queryTime`:
        Query the Ably system for the current time when making token requests.
    Token Details:
      .specification: [RSA4a, RSA4, TO3j3]
      .synopsis: |
        `tokenDetails`
    Token Request:
      .specification: [TO3j2]
      .synopsis: |
        `token`
    Token String:
      .specification: [RSA4a, RSA4, TO3j2]
      .synopsis: |
        `token`
    URL:
      .api_documentation: |
        Typically, in a browser environment, the `authUrl` provided would be a URL relative to an endpoint under the same origin.
        This endpoint issues tokens to trusted clients.
        Client requests can, for example, be trusted based on session cookies.

        There are several options you can specify along with `authUrl`:

        - `authMethod` - the default “GET” method will be used, unless “POST” is specified here
        - `authHeaders` - allows you to pass additional headers as required, depending on your use case
        - `authParams` - allows you to pass additional query parameters, depending on your use case
      .specification:
        [RSA8c, TO3j6, TO3j7, TO3j8, TO3j9, AO2c, AO2d, AO2e, AO2f, RSA4]
      .synopsis: |
        `authUrl`, `authMethod`, `authHeaders` and `authParams`:
        Service `Auth#requestToken` calls by querying a provided URL (`authURL`) to obtain a token request,
        or the token itself. Supports specification of other HTTP request properties (method, headers and params).
    Use Token Authentication:
      .specification: [RSA4, RSA14, TO3j4]
      .synopsis: |
        `useTokenAuth`:
        Specifies that Token Auth, not Basic Auth, must be used.
  Client Identifier:
    .specification: [RSC17, RSA7, RSA15, RTN2d, TO3a]
    .synopsis: |
      `clientId`:

      Overrides client library defaults for `TokenParams`.

      for binary data.
  Disable Transport Layer Security:
    .specification: [TO3d, RSC18]

    .synopsis: |
      `fallbackHosts`:
      Override the default fallback hosts, for REST and Realtime connections.
      Defaults are autogenerated from `environment` so this option should not be needed for
      anything other than development environments.
  HTTP Connection Open Timeout:
    .specification: TO3l3
    .synopsis: |
      `httpOpenTimeout`
  Inject Agents:

      this differently for idiomatic reasons that make sense for the language, framework
      or runtime platform.

    .specification: [TO3l9, CD2d]
    .synopsis: |
      `maxFrameSize`:

    .synopsis: |
      `port`:
      Overrides the TCP port to be used for insecure connections, where TLS has been disabled,
      for development environments only.
  Proxy:
    .synopsis: |
      `proxy`:
      Support for specify an HTTP proxy server to use for making REST and Realtime connections through.
      Typically includes options for `host`, `port`, `username`, `password` and HTTP authentication type.
      May also include option to specify host names that are not to be proxied.
