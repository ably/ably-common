## Ably Realtime Error Codes

Ably's [client library SDKs](https://www.ably.io/download), and the [core realtime platform](https://www.ably.io/platform), use common error codes. These error codes are stored and maintained in the shared public JSON file [errors.json](./errors.json).

In addition, a list of error codes and corresponding support articles to help understand how to resolve common problems relating to these error codes can be seen in [errorsHelp.json](./errorsHelp.json).

If you need help understanding any error codes, or need technical support, please visit the [Ably support desk](https://www.ably.io/support).
